  <h3>Nintendo granted patent on the mitochondria at a critical point in their lawsuit against Palworld</h3>
  <h4></h4>

  <div id="content">
    <p>It should be no secret that Nintendo is essentially the Devilmine of intellectual property, doing whatever they can to ruin the lives of innocent people who just so much as dared to make a Pokemon fangame.
    This new patent is no exception; on September 15, Nintendo has acquired a patent in Japan on mitochondria- yes, the same mitochondria that power the cells of you and me and everyone else on this planet.
    A spokesperson of Nintendo told The Turnip in an interview on September 16, "We at Nintendo could not be more grateful that our patent on the mitochondria was granted. Finally, we'll be able to crush Pocketpair once and for all in this legal war!"</p><br>
    
  <div id="content">
    <p>This "legal war" between Nintendo and Pocketpair has been going on for just under a year, having started in mid-September 2024 when Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair in Tokyo's district court, alleging that their game Palworld infringes on Pokemon-related patents owned by Nintendo.
    Palworld is an open-world game that involves Pals, creatures similar to Pokemon that can also be caught in throwable balls, which, you guessed it, is one of those Pokemon-related patents.
    However, to call Palworld a Pokemon ripoff is wrong. While the game has been called "Pokemon with guns", the game does have a lot of mechanics not seen in Pokemon games, including, of course, guns. (though non-Pokemon mechanics are to be expected in a game in which Pokemon wasn't even one of the main inspirations)
    Palworld has also been accused of infringing more patents than just the aforementioned throwable balls and the new mitochondria patent.</p><br>

  <div id="content">
    <p>Nintendo's patent of the mitochondria, which was devised in early February and only finally granted this past Sunday, is a never-before-seen act of legal brilliance from the gaming giant: destroying a competitor product by destroying the people behind it.
    Leaked memos from Nintendo executives have revealed that the company's plan is to grant every living eukaryote a free license to have and use mitochondria, but with the catch that Nintendo can terminate the license at any time. Nintendo then plans to, of course, terminate the license for the Palworld developers, and only the Palworld developers.</p><br>
