  <h3>Nintendo granted patent on the mitochondria at a critical point in their lawsuit against Palworld</h3>
  <h4></h4>

  <div id="content">
    <p>It should be no secret that Nintendo is essentially the Devilmine of intellectual property, doing whatever they can to ruin the lives of innocent people who just so much as dared to make a Pokemon fangame.
    This new patent is no exception; on September 14, Nintendo has acquired a patent in Japan on mitochondria- yes, the same mitochondria that power the cells of you and me and everyone else on this planet.
    A spokesperson of Nintendo told The Turnip in an interview on September 15, "We at Nintendo could not be more grateful that our patent on the mitochondria was granted. Finally, we'll be able to crush Pocketpair once and for all in this legal war!"</p><br>

    <p>This "legal war" between Nintendo and Pocketpair has been going on for just under a year, having started in mid-September 2024 when Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair in Tokyo's district court, alleging that their game Palworld infringes on Pokemon-related patents owned by Nintendo.
    Palworld is an open-world game that involves Pals, creatures similar to Pokemon that can also be caught in throwable balls, which, you guessed it, is one of those Pokemon-related patents.
    However, to call Palworld a Pokemon ripoff is wrong. While the game has been called "Pokemon with guns", the game does have a lot of mechanics not seen in Pokemon games, including, of course, guns. (though non-Pokemon mechanics are to be expected in a game in which Pokemon wasn't even one of the main inspirations)
    Palworld has also been accused of infringing more patents than just the aforementioned throwable balls and the new mitochondria patent.</p><br>

    <p>Nintendo's patent of the mitochondria, which was devised in early February and only finally granted this past Saturday, is a never-before-seen act of legal brilliance from the gaming giant: destroying a competitor product by destroying the people behind it.
    Leaked memos from Nintendo executives have revealed that the company's plan is to grant every living eukaryote a free license to have and use mitochondria, but with the catch that Nintendo can terminate the license at any time. Nintendo then plans to, of course, terminate the license for the Palworld developers, and only the Palworld developers.
    Once Nintendo has revoked the licenses for Pocketpair, the company plans to immediately sue everyone whose licenses they just revoked for having and using mitochondria, which, once again, Nintendo now owns the rights to.
    This will then force the death of everyone involved with Palworld, since of course you can't survive with no mitochondria. An anonymous tipper has said that Nintendo plans to use this strategy in future legal battles, especially once they get the mitochondria patent in other countries like the US.</p><br>

  <div id="content">
    <p>Online reactions to Nintendo's actions have been universally negative. After word of this patent first broke out, numerous people went to the official Nintendo subreddit to talk about how scared they were that their rights to live are now in the sole control of a soulless corporation.
    One post about ways to stay safe in the event your license to the mitochondria gets revoked quickly became the most upvoted post on the subreddit, garnering hundreds of thousands of upvotes and tens of thousands of comments just a few hours after being posted, only stopping once the large amount of activity crashed Reddit's servers. At the time of writing, Reddit's servers are still down.
    Many YouTubers, such as penguinz0, have made videos about this patent, admonishing Nintendo and advising viewers not to make fangames or any other creations involving Nintendo's IPs at all. A Nintendo spokesperson privately messaged The Turnip a few hours ago, saying that these YouTubers, and other critics of Nintendo and their new patent thankfully will not get their licenses revoked; only violators of Nintendo's IPs will be given that treatment.
    We at The Turnip do not condone Nintendo's actions, and are currently working in conjunction with the swarms of angry Internet users and other opponents to this patent to get it struck down in court.</p><br>
