  <div id="content">
    <p>On November 17, 2022, an investigation was launched regarding a jury member of the O. J. Simpson trial, alleging that said jury member was actually MLB umpire Angel Hernandez in disguise. This investigation started after a group of law school students watched a video of the OJ trial on November 14 for their law school studies, and Jonathan Ganschweiss<!--Yes I know this translates to "goose sweat" in German, that was actually unintentional but I'm keeping it like that because fuck you-->, one of the law school students, noticed that one of the jurors sounded eerily like Hernandez. Ganschweiss notified local police shortly after, alleging that the juror was actually Angel Hernandez and that the cops should investigate. At first, the cops dismissed the allegations, claiming that said allegations were made by "a drunken college idiot." But then, one of the police officers, a man named Mike Callavere, noticed that the juror did actually eerily sound like Hernandez, and that's how the investigation started.</p>
